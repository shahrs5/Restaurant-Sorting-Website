# Restaurant-Sorting-Website

This is a website that I have made using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Flask and SQLite. This is a simple restaurant filtering website according to filters and sorted by rating. This website was made to demostrate my ability to connect frontend with backend along with a SQL database. This website also has a flask login system to demostrate my ability to add in other features.
